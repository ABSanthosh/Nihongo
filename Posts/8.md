## Note:

There an unfortunate news. The website I was using([LearnWithOliver](https://www.learnwitholiver.com/japanese/)) was a premium service all along! 0_0 and I started to get used to it. Now they want me to pay $9 every month to play the audio of the word(LOL)

I found a way to bring back the audio feature(at least for the words) by indexing all the words in the site and their word id and by making a browser extension. Hopefully it works and I continue learning japanese. _Fingers crossed!_

Alright. This is it for today.
