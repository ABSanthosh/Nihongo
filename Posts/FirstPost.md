# ðŸŒ¸Konnichiwa sekai! ðŸŒ¸ (Hello World!)

## Introduction

So my goal is to understand fluent Japanese and also try to speak Japanese without any help.



This is definitely a hercules task as there are around 10,000 Japanese words used per day on average. (Src. Some random youtube video lol)



As per my plan, If I learn 25 words per day, it would take me



```
10000/25 = 400
```



400 days to get somewhere with my progress.



This is not an overnight process and I'm fully aware of it. I'm planning to increase the number of words per day as I get used to the flow.



Since I don't have a lot of spare time, I'm not going to learn to read Hiragana,
katakana or Kanji. I'm only going to be using Romaji, which is just the roman alphabetization of the Japanese language.


There won't be any "Introduction" section in the upcoming blogs.

## 5 Sentences for the day

| S.NO | Sentence                                  | Literal meaning        | Contextual Meaning     |
| :--- | :---------------------------------------- | :--------------------- | :--------------------- |
| 1    | watashi wa kono ie ne sunde imasu         | I this house living    | I live in this house   |
| 2    | watashi wa kyoshi desu                    | I am Teacher is        | I am a teacher         |
| 3    | watashi wa nihiongo o benkoyo shite imasu | I am Japanese learning | I am learning Japanese |
| 4    | anata wa shigotowa nandesuka?             | your job what?         | What is your job       |
| 5    | watashi wa piano ga tokui desu            | I am piano good at is  | I am good at piano     |

As you can see, The literal meaning is not the contextual meaning in most situations. This is because,

| Language | Follows             |
| :------- | :------------------ |
| English  | Subject-Verb-Object |
| Japanese | Subject-Object-Verb |

This is much like prefix and postfix notation in programming.

Alright. This is it for today.

Byeee!
