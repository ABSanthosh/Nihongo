## Sentence formation in Japanese

- Japanese is a SOV language
- English is a SVO language

&#8627; In SOV languages, verb is at the end of sentences.
<br><br>

### What's a Verb?

&#8627; A verb is a word that in syntax conveys an action, an occurrence or a state of being.<br>
&#8627; In other words, verbs are action words that describes what the subject is doing.

Eg:<br>
|||
|:--|:--|
|`Jimbo eats an apple`|`Jimbo wa ringo tabemishita`|
|&#8627; Subject: Jimbo|&#8627; Subject: Jimbo|
|&#8627; Verb: Eats|&#8627; Object: ringo(Apple)|
|&#8627; Object: An apple|&#8627; Verb: eats|

## Desu - word

&#8627; desu is a copula. It connects the subject of the sentence with the predicate.<br>
&#8627; The most basic structure is `A is B`<br>
&#8627; Desu is used in the end of a sentence usually.<br>
&#8627; Desu never comes in the end of sentences that have verbs ending in "masu"<br>

Eg:<br>
`Tom wa ocha o nomimasu desu` - Incorrect<br>
`Tom wa ocha o nomi masu` - correct<br>

&#8627; When speaking about the past, desu becomes deshita

Eg:<br>
`Tesuto wa kanta deshita` - Exam was easy<br>
`Kino wa watashi no tanjobi` - Yesterday was my birthday<br>

&#8627; Levels of politeness in desu
- desu: basic polite form
- da: casual(friends and family)
- dearu: formally written(newspaper)
- de gozaimasu: most formal(Someone superior/important)
<br><br>
